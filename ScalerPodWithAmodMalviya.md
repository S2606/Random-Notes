Notes:-

1. Why does a CTO level or a co-founder level personal still codes? Because one to just love building things, people will manage to do both technical as well as non-technical work if done for the reason mentioned before(kya laga koi hi-fi answer hoga?) Agar hi-fi(but practical answer) chaiye to yeh suno:- 
    - Hard to be relevant with current technologies without using them hands on
    - Having empathy for developers working with them, it disappears fast on not using them in your day-to-day life. Hard to understand their pain, the complexities to get through in order to solve the problems.
    - Difficult to take judgements on the technologies, arrive at a deep understanding since they change quite fast.
 
2. Software Development(SD) vs Software Engineering(SE) - SD is a space blessed with teremendous amount of improvement, in terms of. Abstraction which it offers. Basically don’t need to know the details uppar uppar se kaam ho jayega, JS is one of the easiest(allows people to express in the easiest possible fashion). Negative effect is that people are far too removed from the tools, machine(just like automatic cars; removing non-productive work but has a cost of limiting what one can do). Started weekend challenge to think deep about the tools being used in day-to-day like. SE is all about rigor. SE can predict how the system is going to behave(for full context go to point 7).

3. What motivates engineers to go deep into systems and languages? 
- when we hit walls, we have maxed something about ourselves(slow way of evolving). Another motivation is curiosity, almost like a survival skills in this industry, almost like learning how to learn. Best way is to look one level below. Can move beyond hitting walls faster by being proactive instead of being reactive.

4. What advice would you give to engineers who are overwhelmed with multiple languages, tech stacks, frameworks to learn? 
- Frameworks can be large in counts, underlying concepts are not that large in count. Pick anything and move ahead, pick one that is heavily used, “highly likely” to have best practices, invest it basic understanding of that framework, benefits that founders are claiming to have in it. Be the person who can defend the language chosen, even if it means asking people who made the choice so be it, looking into every aspect of how the framework is being used. Very important to deeply familiarise ourself with the toolset to be used, which gives us some basis. That basis is helpful when we go out of that framework. Eg:- Reacts ui changes on state change during runtime, Svelte does the same on compile time. Point is these patterns cannot be found if they are seen syntactically. Concept or Construct understand helps in seeing them and hence makes it less overwhelming if seen in this manner. 

5. How to transcend from thinking in framework to thinking in concept? 
- Almost the point mentioned above, another analogy could be thinking in one language was speaking in another. Basically creating the pain in your brain by exploring multiple languages, frameworks.

6. Advice for mid-senior engineers to grow in their career? 
- Early-Level Engineers - Only coding, no design. As they progress, incremental changes in design and with time they go to creating from scratch stage. In this stage, failure can happen because of not been able to think about ambiguous scenarios. For eg:- if one is planning to start e-commerce company, is it being thought like a marketplace or first party seller. Why was this asked because this can have quite a lot of difference in terms of low level design, in marketplace model you would have sellers and vendors. these things float throughout the whole system, something like a seller id which is present in all parts of the system. Great engineers excel at identifying these ambiguous choices, crucial junction of decision(impact 6 months or an year down the line). They are also great at thinking higher order effects(areas which are needed to keep flexible, fungible, keeping the door open ;), tradeoff that come with it, tl;dr foreseeing the future). Actively practicing it enables their growth. Easily noticeable on technical side, far less on EM side(easier to get promotions on moving from sde3 to EM). The more one trains on the point mentioned above, the faster one would grow. 

7. How to take time for learning when working at startups? 
- If you are getting time for side projects in a startups, there is something one needs to think about(point of concern). The learning happens if one is busy productively in the startup. For eg:- RCA’s can be a good source of knowing how deeply an individual has gone for that problem. Approaching the problem is far more important than just blindly taking calls. For eg:- there is a subset of code that needs frequent change, and 1 out of every 30 deployments fail. So by compartmentalising the code into another service, one can minimising the cascading failure, thereby improving overall stability. If one is not committing to it, likely being intellectually dishonest. 
 
8. Why it is important to keep learning throughout the career?
-  If you want to strive for excellence, be technically relevant in a rapidly changing industry. Good enough competence is an epidemic in the industry or the lack of it for the fact that good enough works. Eventually one will hit limits of what one knows, if one is not hitting, to put it simple words repetitive task.  If one does not have habit of digging deep and do not have habit of retaining information at the fundamental level, it will be washed off, leading up to hitting the wall. Either become a builder or a creator or get screwed up in the near future ;)

9. Is learning CS fundamentals a requirement or just start building projects? 
- Lets break the question into three parts 
    - Am I using the things I have learned or not? 
    - In what way was the information presented to me? 
    - What effort have I put in in order to understand it? 
What imprint has that knowledge left onto us. If we are going to wait for the world to present a problem where we have to use it, then there is a problem Assuming something to be useful only if it is used today is a flawed understanding. Absolutely no knowledge ever goes into waste. 

10. Learning for short-term vs long-term? 
- Do you want to survive or excel?? Is getting an answer in stack overflow good enough?? Also a sentence from the talk in Amod’s quotes:- “In linear algebra, there's a concept of vector space and basis vectors. Every vector in that (potentially infinite) space can be created as a linear combo of these basis vectors. Learning is similar, focus on the basis vectors, rest everything is just a linear combo of it.”

11. Role of peers and community? 
- Significant. Life-changing for me

12. Should engineers go into product management? 
- Motivation. By what? Jumping to the control plane(PM giving orders etc.) and on the lines of what pm’s actually do. Get into it if you love user centric problem solving. Ambiguity resolution will always be there irrespective of the trade. Technical ambiguity is actually linked to product ambiguity. Frameworks of higher order thinking etc. apply here as well.  Sometime PM’s do act as a postmen b/w business and techies.

13. How to judge what is hype and what is substance when picking a new domain? 
- Focus on fundamentals will help in figuring it out whether it is a hype or not. Violating it can be smelled as something wrong. Eg:- Blockchain Email. If our interests are kept at the surface level, there is no way one can avoid fomo. Two ways - Learning by jhand, making that bloody mistake and getting embarrassed by your own arrogance, incompetency or Learning by trial to fire. Learning can be accelerated by thinking first how would in have implemented it, then checking out the code. 

14. How to discover, and get involved in good open source projects? 
- No specific answer, just “grep” the bug one is facing while using the code.
